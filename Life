When life gives you lemons...

Hi Michelle, i dont really get what it means :(

"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is a proverbial phrase used to encourage optimism and a can-do attitude in the face of adversity or misfortune. Lemons suggest bitterness, while lemonade is a sweet drink.

"Life handed him a lemon,
As Life sometimes will do.
His friends looked on in pity,
Assuming he was through.
They came upon him later,
Reclining in the shade
In calm contentment, drinking
A glass of lemonade."

"I have never been afraid of trouble. I have always had this slogan: If somebody hands you a lemon, make lemonade of it.

Now, I know. Thanks Michelle!
